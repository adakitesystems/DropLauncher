# DropLauncher v0.01a
This program is still in the testing phase.

# Third-party Libraries/Applications
* [bwheadless.exe](https://github.com/tscmoo/bwheadless) to load the bots into StarCraft.exe
* [FileDrop.java](http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/filedrop/) for dropping files into the program

* Does not kill processes yet. If a bot joins a game and the game does not start, there is no way to end the process besides Windows Task Manager.
